# This project is a basic simulation of an exam.
# You can add more test prompt questions if you'd like,
# just make sure it is in ".txt" format. The exam
# will select one prompt randomly from the ones that are in this folder to display as the exam question. 

# More information about the algorithm for this
# exam and how the code works concurrently,
# see "notes.doc".
